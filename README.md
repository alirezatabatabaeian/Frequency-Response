### ***Introduction:***

***Frequency response is a measure of how a system, such as an audio system or a control system, responds to different frequencies of an input signal. In the context of audio systems, frequency response refers to how accurately a system reproduces different frequencies in a musical signal. In the context of control systems, frequency response refers to how the system responds to sinusoidal inputs of different frequencies. Plotting the frequency response of a system involves inputting a range of sinusoidal signals at various frequencies and measuring the output signal. The results of these measurements can be plotted on a graph, with frequency on the x-axis and the magnitude of the output signal on the y-axis. This graph is called a frequency response plot.***

### ***Implementation:***

***In this app you can add arbitrary pole(s) and zero(s) to the system and plot the frequency response of it:***
